    "1. It `assert`s that the input variable is a 2-dimensional numpy array.\n",
    "2. Then it stores the dimensions of the array as `L` (number of rows) and `W` (number of columns).\n",
    "3. Using `numpy.random.randint()`, four coordinates are chosen to represent the coverage boundaries.\n",
    "    - This is done in two steps to get the length and width separately. \n",
    "    - The numpy module selects from a uniformly distributed, discreet distribution, so each possible value has an equal chance of getting selected.\n",
    "    - The range of possible results are set to be from 0 to L or W - 1. This range matches the indices of nodes available in the input array.\n",
    "    - To clarify, if both results are the same, then the coverage gets a width of one column. If they yield \"2\" and \"4\", then the resulting coverage is 3 columns wide across columns 2 thorugh 4.\n",
    "    - This is due to coverage being based on discreet nodes rather than boundaries or ranges along an axis.\n",
    "    - Additionally, this method as the benefit of never generating a rectangle of area 0. E.g. Coordinates $(0,0,0,0)$ would still have an area of 1, as it would cover the node at row index 0, column 0.\n",
    "4. The coordinates are ordered from smallest to greatest and concatenated into a single tuple.\n",
    "    - They are put in order of first row, last row, first column, last column.\n",
    "    - This makes it easier to refer to coordinates by their index in the tuple.\n",
    "5. A variable is called, `rectPlot`, which will store the plot of which nodes are covered by the randomly generated coordinates. It is the element-wise product of the input and 0, making it an array of 0's at first.\n",
    "6. Next `iterPlot` is made using `np.nditer()`. The `'multi_index'` flag makes the row and column index available, and `'writeonly'` lets it write into the original array `rectPlot`.\n",
    "    - The function iterates over each node in the array starting at index (0,0) going across columns then down rows.\n",
    "    - At each node, it checks whether the indices are within the row and column range of the randomly generated coordinates. comparisons are made with `<=` to achieve the behavior described above.\n",
    "    - Nodes within the range of coverage are converted to a value 1. Otherwise, they are left as 0.\n",
    "7. Afterwards, the `rectPlot` is checked for correct dimensions and non-zero coverage and `return`ed as the result."

    "**How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `assert` that the input is an `ndarray` and that it only has 1's and 0's. (Need ot put it in still)\n",
    "2. Make `inPlot` iterable with `numpy.nditer()` and iterate through each element looking for points within the new tower's coverage (indicated by value of 1's).\n",
    "    - If the value is 0, do nothing.\n",
    "    - If the value is 1, feed the input plot and row, column indices to encapsulated function `sweep_from_corner()`\n",
    "    - Then feed `sweep_from_corner()` the transposed input plot with the row, column indices swapped. Include `True` input to inform the function that the plot has been transposed prior to putting it through the function.\n",
    "    - `sweep_from_corner()` yields the biggest rectangles with the starting point as its upper-left corner. Both results get stored in the list of candidate rectangles, `rectList`.\n",
    "3. How `sweep_from_corner()` generates plots of candidate rectangles.\n",
    "    - Its inputs are the `inPlot` from the main function (*ndarray*), a row index (*int*), column index (*int*), and  whether the input has been transposed (*bool*). The indices are used as the first row and column with the rectangle.\n",
    "    - This function is defined separately due to being called twice each time a starting corner is identified.\n",
    "    - Starting from the row and column index given, first it scans across the row by increasing index until it reaches the end or the zero. The last column with value 1 is recorded as the last column of the rectangle. * Note: It is possible that the same column is the first and last column.\n",
    "    - Then the function iterates down each row, checking whether its slice of the columns only contains 1's. The last row index for which this is true is saved as the last row of the rectangle.\n",
    "    - A new array of same dimensions as the input array is made. The function iterates through each element and places a 1 if it is within the column and row range of the rectangle; leaves a 0 otherwise.\n",
    "    - This new array is `return`ed as the output of the function. If transposed is `True`, it will transpose the array back to its original orientation.\n",
    "    - **Main Pro**: Limits the arrays that need to be saved to memory, as opposed to generating a set of all possible rectangles within the total plot area in a completely bottom-up approach.\n",
    "    - **Main Con**: Introduces more nested loops, increasing the number of steps to get to the solution.\n",
    "4. Once the list of all of the candidate rectangles is made, it is checked for length. If the length is 0, then an array of zeros is returned as the final output. This is done ot avoid feeding empty iterables to the upcoming `max()` function.\n",
    "5. The candidate with the largest coverage is picked by taking the sum over each array. More 1's means more coverage.\n",
    "6. It goes back into the list and looks for more arrays with the same area, since `max()` only yields one result. These are all saved into a new list, `allLargest`.\n",
    "7. From the list of `allLargest` rectangles, one is randomly chosen by index, picked by calling `numpy.random.randint()`. This is a uniform, discreet distribution, so each array has an equal chance of being chosen.\n",
    "8. A quick `assert` for dimensions and another checking that the coverage nodes in the output are a subset of the input.\n",
    "9. `return`s the final coverage plot for the tower, ready to be added into the plot of overall coverage."

    "This frees the function to break after an arbitrary number of loops, since the number of towers that will fill the whole plot is not known beforehand.\n",
    "4. In the loop, make a random tower, trim it by its overlap with pre-existing coverage, and trim again to its largest rectangle. Uses `make_random_tower()`, `remove_overlap()`, and `get_largest_rectangle()` in that order.\n",
    "5. Add the processed tower coverage to the overall coverage plot by element-wise addition. Add one to the tower counter `nBuilt`.\n",
    "6. If n=0, return the current value of the tower counter. Otherwise, calculate the total area covered by taking the sum of all elements in the plot. Each covered node should have a value of 1, which translates to an area of 1 unit$^2$. Return a tuple containing the coverage area and the fraction of the total area covered."
