    "- The plot of land is a flat rectangle whose dimensions can be described by integer units.\n",
    "- Each tower is placed randomly and has a random range of coverage.\n",
    "- Each tower's coverage is also rectangular and has integer dimensions of the same uints.\n",
    "- If a tower is placed and overlaps a pre-existing tower's coverage, the new tower's coverage is reduced to its largest rectangle outside of the already covered range.\n",
